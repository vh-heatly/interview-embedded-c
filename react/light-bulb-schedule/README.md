This project is setup using React v18 and Vite v4.

### Tasks
1. Code walktrough – go through the code and discuss it with your interviewer, try to explain your understanding of the code.
2. Schedule creation – you have access to the light bulbs and the current (mocked) time. Your task is to create a schedule that changes the "on"-status of a set of light bulbs. The schedule should turn on all light bulbs on a specific time, and turn them off on another specific time.
