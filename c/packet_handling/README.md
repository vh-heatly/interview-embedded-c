# Packet handling

A real world example of (poor) packet handling.

The goal is for the interviewee to look at the code, discuss with the interviewer about what they think is going on, and point out

- what they think is wrong with the code, if there is any,
- how they would like to fix the problem, if there is any,
- how they could "improve the chances" of correctness,
- how they would like to improve it in general.
